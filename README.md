## WallRunner Pro 3000

A symphony of emotions, written in Python.

WallRunner Pro 3000 is actually a game written in Python for a *very* specific platform.
It started out as a way for me to learn more about Python and at the same time utilize a
16x2 LCD that I had lying around. And so, the best game this side of Jupiter was born!

Your mission is to dodge the evil walls.. that's it. We're not even sure if the walls are
actually evil or not, but they'll kill you regardless. That's just the way they were made.
